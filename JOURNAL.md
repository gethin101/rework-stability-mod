# 15/2/26 - Coming up with idea & ReadMe

Today, I thought of many ideas for my printer mod but ended up deciding on making a custom camera system for the A1 mini. I thought about how I can make this and started to plan out the design in the readme. I did some research on components and put together a rough BOM with links and prices (as you can see below). I first decided to use a generic camera remote like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wireless-Bluetooth-Shutter-Control-Compatible/dp/B0C3MDRGGQ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1AUUAI6KZOU9P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QVLF0H7hQrvwdcD5cQPL7kmGSj1CB8wCJjuq92bOQZTdGuGGy8UuHkAomWuRWlMsNT12CPv4abk_rd7BKORY1ZI1Bq3hkXjuYGyrUjMXWgxQNq2ZkX04FeLPp8Tv0dhOy5ANBi-qcXodvXw1pUbV9qVUa6Xa152H0fe0YUT6wCSFRn7Tm3ruk35WeQFy8U-kx0qaj--o2apszfDS6qf9W77vzDKOmrJk2CwK9EbaQ30.U_yHoSGx9FSXXItNZ2bkZa7ZnEE9pOYg_1XBc-cTTfY&dib_tag=se&keywords=camera+clicker&qid=1771172995&sprefix=camera+clicker%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-5) but then switched to using a KW11-3Z microswitch to lower costs and as it should be more interesting to use.
