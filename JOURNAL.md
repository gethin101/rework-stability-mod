# 15/2/26 - Coming up with idea & ReadMe

Today, I thought of many ideas for my printer mod but ended up deciding on making a custom camera system for the A1 mini. I thought about how I can make this and started to plan out the design in the readme. I did some research on components and put together a rough BOM with links and prices (as you can see below)
